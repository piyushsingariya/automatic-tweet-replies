# How to install Tweepy

First, check your Python version with python3 --version or python --version on your terminal.

#### If you don't have Python 3 installed (if the above command fails):

Either you try to install Python 3 on your computer OR use some website offer online terminal operations like I said PythonAnywhere

#### If you have Python 3.6, you can just run: 
pip3 install tweepy

#### If you have Python 3.7, run the following instead: 
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git@2efe385fc69385b57733f747ee62e6be12a1338b

If the above command doesn't work, try replacing pip3 with pip also.

#### If you have Python 3.7 and want to use pipenv, use:

pipenv install -e git+https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git@2efe385fc69385b57733f747ee62e6be12a1338b#egg=tweepy

#### And if you have Python 2.7 or something just run
pip install tweepy
